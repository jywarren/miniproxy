MINIPROXY

This allows access of any website through an https SSL proxy, simply by navigating to:

https://my-url.com?q=http://target-url.com

It modifies all links in the content to use the proxy as well. Currently, it does not intercept relative URLs or URLS in javascript or CSS files. 

Pretty much the entire system is in app/controllers/proxy_controller.rb, with just one route in config/routes.rb

Have fun.
